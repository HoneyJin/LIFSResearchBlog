Issues on the cause of death used in this study were 10 while issues on the time of death were 3.

					A judge and an investigator use reasoning to investigate a criminal fact in a criminal case. However, reasoning always contains errors due to limitation of their cognitive abilities and restrictions in working. Purpose of this study is to detect an error of reasoning occurring in fact finding of a criminal fact and to suggest a visualization model to find a reasonable fact discovery. This study aimed to apply reasoning visualization model to an actual case and then, to review whether it was possible for a visualization model to clearly reveal reasoning part of fact judgment to detect an error. The case used in this study was a murder case which actually happened as follows; the defendant (husband) came back home and found a victim (wife) who lay in a bathroom with an unusual position, and the defendant reported it to the police.
