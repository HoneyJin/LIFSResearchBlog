					The implementation of the revised Korean Criminal Procedure Act in 2020 grants a subjective position to the police to be responsible for the primary investigation, thus making the police investigator's case review process unprecedentedly important. In addition, newly amended legislation strengthens the direct investigation of evidence in courts, hence, logical proving cases in court based on objective evidence are further requested. With such change, the verification of the investigation process through argumentation is expected to be a core competency required by the police. However, the existing case analysis tools focus on collecting and analyzing evidence rather than logical verification, therefore, an argument analysis system that can derive legal claims based on evidence is required for case analysis with logical completeness. The purpose of this study is to devise an argument mining model that allows investigators to examine the case's argument structure with a quick and objective perspective by (1) automatically extracting the argument components, and (2) classifying the relationship between the extracted argument pairs.
