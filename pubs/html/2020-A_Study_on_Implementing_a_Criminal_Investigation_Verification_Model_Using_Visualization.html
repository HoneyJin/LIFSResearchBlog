					With the recent revision of the Criminal Procedure Act and the Prosecutors&#39; Office Act, the Korean police have been able to conduct responsible investigations, such as exercising their investigative powers as the primary investigative agency and the right to end the investigation when there is no criminal charge. However, if a suspect or a victim challenges the validity of the investigation, the case is sent to the prosecution. In such cases, the objectivity of the investigation is directly relevant to the credibility of the investigation. Also, as the admissibility of the prosecution&#39;s suspect interrogation records as evidence became limited, lawyers are likely to attack logical vulnerabilities in the argument structure of the investigation results at the trial. Therefore, the police must develop a method to secure the validity of the investigation results objectively. This study systematically analyzes the reasoning methods used in criminal investigations and their issues to proactively respond to changes in the environment of criminal proceedings. It also suggests the necessity of introducing a new paradigm that divides the police investigation process into Crime Reconstruction and Crime Verification.
