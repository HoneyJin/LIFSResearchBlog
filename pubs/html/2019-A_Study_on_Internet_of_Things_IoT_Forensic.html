					There are previous studies about digital forensics in terms of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, and cases using IoT device data for crime investigations. However, the acquisition and analysis of data in the IoT environment are still a challenge for digital forensic investigators. In addition, there are no accepted practical and comprehensive digital forensic procedures for investigators and law enforcement agencies to perform digital forensic investigations on IoT-based environments. This work proposes a new model for IoT Forensic specifically for the Data Acquisition procedure from the IoT ecosystem. The model is tested using experiments conducted on IoT devices. The experiment includes the research aspect of investigating the actual IoT devices in order to provide a complete picture of the model. The experiment was divided into Cloud, Network, Client (PC, Mobile) and Device/hub side for each IoT device. The results from the experiments showed that data can be extracted from each category of cloud, network, client, and device, and that the data should be collected as soon as possible with the related devices and collected as much as possible.
