					Extracting meaningful information from the factual details of judicial decisions plays a crucial role in understanding cases, and the training of artificial intelligence models for information extraction requires high-quality datasets.

In this study, we leverage the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to efficiently construct a training dataset. Specifically, we propose a method called "GPT-3.5&Annotator-in-the-loop" where we perform initial annotation using Simple prompts with GPT-3.5, followed by human review to build a higher-quality dataset by identifying prompts that yield better results.
