					Smart home Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming the mainstream technologies that are being integrated into today society. Recent cyber-attacks and researches on these devices indicate smart home IoT developers do not design and implement data protection solutions comprehensively in the IoT ecosystem. These security weaknesses have different implications for user privacy, safety and digital forensic investigations.
