					Over the past few years, the government has increased investment in artificial intelligence and big data by promoting the complete digitization of public agencies. This digitization along with digital transformation has brought more attention to accessing court documents particularly the judgments and opinions. It has been announced that as of 2023, all civil cases will be available to the general public in machine-readable format.
