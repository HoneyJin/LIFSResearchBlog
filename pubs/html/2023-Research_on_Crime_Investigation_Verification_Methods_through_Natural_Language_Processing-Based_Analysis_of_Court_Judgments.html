					The recent amendments to the Korean Criminal Procedure Act have brought significant changes to the investigative environment of the police. By granting the authority to conclude investigations to the police, the process of reviewing cases by police investigators has become unprecedentedly crucial. Furthermore, the growing trend of direct investigation of evidence in courts demands logically complete arguments in the courtroom.
