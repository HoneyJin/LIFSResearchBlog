					The Korean National Police became authorized to perform independent investigations due to the revision of the Korean Criminal Procedure Act in 2020. As a result, unprecedented importance was placed on the review process of cases investigated by police. However, existing case analysis support tools do not focus on logical verification, tending instead to focus on collecting and analyzing evidence. This fundamental gap in the review and analysis of cases necessitates a support system for argument analysis. The purpose of this study is to (1) automatically extract and classify elements of arguments found in related case documents, (2) group these elements, and (3) retrieve potential alternative hypotheses from a repository of these elements. Argument[ation] Mining is defined as a technology that identifies arguments and evidence and analyzes arguments' structure. To our knowledge, there is no appropriate corpus for argumentation mining available in Korean. We have collected 73 Korean first instance criminal cases, which we analyzed using a modified Toulmin model. We have selected features based on previous research in argument mining to classify the elements of arguments, especially for the legal domain. However, instead of the usual two- to three types of arguments (premise, claim, the main claim), we have attempted to classify the sentences into six types of arguments based on the modified Toulmin model (datum, warrant, backing, claim, rebuttal and rebuttal support).
