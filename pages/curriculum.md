### Research Positions and Scholarships
<span id="LIFSRE"></span>
In the Legal Informatics and Forensic Science Institute, we strive to support each student as much as possible. This also includes financial support through research grants.

We attempt to hire each LIFS graduate student on a research project to help supplement their income while studying. Hired researchers also receive tuition reduction from 60% to 100%.

We provide scholarships when resources are available. However, we cannot guarantee funding support until after you have been accepted to Hallym University. After you are admitted to one of our programs, then we can discuss what funding opportunities are available, and what positions would be a good fit.
