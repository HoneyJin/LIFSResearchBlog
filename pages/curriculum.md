### LIFS Master's Courses

The Master’s in Legal Informatics and Forensic Science is an advanced degree focusing on the analysis of technology and crime. It is a multidisciplinary program that gives students an in-depth understanding of Criminal Justice, Cybercrime Law, Digital Forensic Science and Data Science.

The Master’s in Legal Informatics and Forensic Science is hosted in the Hallym University School of Global Studies, enabling Hallym University to provide LIFS students with a unique, international focus. If you are interested in joining us, please don’t hesitate to contact us (rspark@hallym.ac.kr). We are available to answer any of your questions, and assist with the application process.

The Master’s in Legal Informatics and Forensic Science is a two-year, full-time course. After completing all courses, students are required to submit a thesis. Thesis research is the final semester. The program schedule is flexible for adults that are currently working; including night and weekend classes. Students that decide to complete the course “full time” will have a mix of online and offline courses.For full-time students, a number of paid research opportunities and scholarships exist. On-campus housing may also be provided in Chuncheon, South Korea.

Each course is three credits. Students usually take two courses per semester (three in the last semesters), plus research assignments. Some courses are elective based on the availability of the instructor.
