This paper is a Master's thesis written by Ari Choi, a student of the Department of International Studies, Major in Legal Informatics and Forensic Science(LIFS), at Hallym University Graduate School.

The title of the thesis is "A Comparative Study on Criminal Judgement Search Models Using Natural Language Processing - Focusing on the motive for the crime."

This paper addresses the need for efficient data processing in the legal tech field, specifically focusing on the search for similar cases based on judgments. The study utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to analyze text judgment data and develop a similar case search model. 

Various embedding models and similarity measurement methods were employed, but inconsistencies were observed in the derived similar events. Human intervention was then introduced for evaluation and ranking, revealing a lack of consensus among evaluators for many reference cases. 

Statistical analysis highlighted the importance of considering the "motivation" behind a crime when screening similar cases. To address this, judgments were classified based on described motives, resulting in a dataset with corresponding keywords and sentences. Machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KoBERT, and KLUE/bert, were trained on this dataset. The Random Forest model performed well with a keyword-based dataset, while the KLUE/bert model excelled with a sentence-based dataset.

This study contributes to enhancing the search for similar cases and provides insights into the role of motivation in criminal judgments. Through the utilization of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, valuable insights are gained, enabling more accurate and effective identification of relevant cases. By emphasizing the significance of motivation, this research offers a fresh perspective on understanding and analyzing criminal judgments, ultimately contributing to the advancement of legal research and decision-making processes.
