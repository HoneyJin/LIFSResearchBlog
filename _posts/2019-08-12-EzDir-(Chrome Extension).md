This is a real simple Chrome Extension for getting Directions using Google Maps.

After playing around with Google Maps page, I learned that the last parts of Google Map URL indicate the From, To, and Via Location that a user types in.

https://www.google.com/maps/dir/FROM/TO/VIA

So, I made a simple extension that may make some people's life slightly more convenient.



It's got no interface or any fancy function.

- Unload this package into your Chrome Browser
- Activate it
- Drag-select the name of a place of visit
- Right click and select "Get Directions"
- Enter your Current Location
- Enjoy your direcitions.

You can see the files in [my Github page](https://github.com/kagented/EzDir).
