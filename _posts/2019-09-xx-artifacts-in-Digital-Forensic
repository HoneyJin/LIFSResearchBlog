People might heard about the term 'artifacts' while doing Digital Forensic.

Artifacts is a trace. It's more than trace, I know but, to make it simple its close to trace.

Just like Edmond Locard said , every contacts leave a trace , people leave trace in the digital device.


For example, if i click the phone application and play with it 20 minute, my phone records at least what phone app i clicked at which time.


In Digital Forensic field, artifacts can be devided into two.


1) data that automatically made by compute such as registry, prefetch,eventlog

2) data that made by human such as mail, documents, SNS.


People who just stepped into Digital Forensic, people might consider the #2 , data that made by human might be better to do a forensic investigation. However, it is powerful , but kind of tricky to use as an digital evidence(ex , some people might try to trick investigator). This is because person's intention is included in these artifacts.


So what we focus is #1, data that automatically made by computer.

If #1 , data that automatically made by computer can prove #2 humans work would make my arguments more strongly. For instance, i am involved in crime and really do not hope to caught by others. I intentionally deleted all the message that can be evidence to reaveal my crime. If Digital Forensic Investigator found the #1 related that i accessed to the email and deleted the message , then i cannot really make up with the word nolonger.
