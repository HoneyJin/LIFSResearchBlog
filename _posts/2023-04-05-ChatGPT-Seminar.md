At the School of Global Studies(SGS) on April 5th, the Prompt Engineering Competition took place with the participation of Professor Ro-Seop Park from Hallym University's Legal Informatics and Forensics Science (LIFS) lab.

The Prompt Engineering Competition is an academic activity that encourages creative problem-solving and the generation of results by utilizing various prompts. During this seminar, graduate students from Hallym University's Legal Informatics and Forensics Science (LIFS) lab, along with students from SGS University, collaborated to explain the process of utilizing ChatGPT to derive output values.

In preparation for the competition, the students met once a week for a month to conduct study sessions with MSc Course student Jee-Won Park from the LIFS lab. During these sessions, they discussed and debated the progress of each team, exchanged opinions on achieving the desired output values, and had dedicated time to ask questions to the graduate student for assistance with challenging aspects.
