In preparation for the competition, the students met once a week for a month to conduct study sessions with MSc Course student Jee-Won Park from the LIFS lab. During these sessions, they discussed and debated the progress of each team, exchanged opinions on achieving the desired output values, and had dedicated time to ask questions to the graduate student for assistance with challenging aspects.
