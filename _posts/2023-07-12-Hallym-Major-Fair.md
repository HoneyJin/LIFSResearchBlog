# Hallym University held the <i>'2023 Hallym Major Fair'</i> on Wednesday, the 12th, at the Hallym Recreation Center on its main campus.

This event was organized as part of the 2023 High School Education Contribution University Support Project to provide high school students with opportunities for career and major exploration. A total of 26 departments (schools) participated in this event.

The 'Hallym Major Fair,' which began in 2018, is the largest-scale major experience program offered by our university for high school students.

The newly established Department of Forensic Information Science and Technology plans to expand and revamp the Legal Information and Forensic Science major from 2024. 
The department aims to select 40 students and nurture talents who can cope with complex problems arising from the rapidly changing society driven by AI and lead advancements in state-of-the-art scientific investigation through the utilization of AI data.


At the booth of the Department of Forensic Information Science and Technology, titled 'Beyond Forensic Science,' they provided information on the requirements for special police recruitment. They also introduced the department's major track, educational objectives, and professors. 
In addition, students had the opportunity to experience firsthand fingerprint collection, along with explanations of activities conducted by the Information Law and Science Research Institute, which utilizes AI (Artificial Intelligence) for crime investigation.
