The '2023 Hallym Major Fair' took place at the Hallym Recreation Center on Hallym University's main campus on Wednesday, the 12th of July, 2023.

The 'Hallym Major Fair' is the largest-scale major experience program offered by our university, starting from 2018. It was organized as part of the 2023 High School Education Contribution University Support Project, aimed at providing high school students with opportunities to explore careers and majors. A total of 26 departments participated in this event.

The Department of Forensic Information Science and Technology, which was recently established, has plans to expand and improve the Legal Information and Forensic Science major starting in 2024. The department's goal is to select 40 students and train them to tackle complex problems arising from our rapidly changing society driven by AI.

At the booth of the Department of Forensic Information Science and Technology, titled 'Beyond Forensic Science', they provided information on the requirements for special police recruitment. They also introduced the department's major track, educational goals, and professors. Additionally, students had the opportunity to experience firsthand fingerprint collection and learn about the activities of the Legal Informatics and Forensic Science Institute at Hallym Uinversity, which uses AI for crime investigation.
