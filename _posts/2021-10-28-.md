**| The police with the authority to terminate the investigation,Criminal investigation verification procedures should be introduced.**


As the police secured the right to terminate the investigation, it was pointed out that it was necessary to introduce a verification process for criminal investigations and to unify the form of the investigation result report with the court ruling.


**| In order to strengthen the police's responsibility investigation, the form of the 'investigation result report' judgment should be unified.**


On the 28th, in the online seminar ‘The Role and Challenges of Police Responsibility Investigation and the Results of Police Law Research’ hosted by Korean National Police Agency and Korean Association of Police & Law, "In order for the police to actively respond to changes in the environment of criminal proceedings, it is necessary to introduce a verification process for criminal investigations and improve ways to write investigation results," Ro-Seop Park, a professor of Law Administration at Hallym University says.


Professor Park said, "As investigations and trials have the same purpose of finding facts, it is natural that the report and the ruling have formal and content similarities. We can reduce objections or disputes in court by presenting investigation results that can be accepted by suspects and lawyers."


Regarding the investigation verification process, the Professor.Park explained, “As the right to terminate the investigation was transferred to the police due to the revision of the Criminal Procedure Act, the "responsible investigation" was further emphasized, and it is necessary to introduce a new paradigm that divides the police investigation process into "the process of reconstructing the incident that occurred" and "the process of verifying it."


Lee Ki-soo, a professor at Chonnam National University who participated in the discussion, also said, "I actively agree with the presenter in that writing an investigation result report in the form of a ruling through practical training will have a good effect on verification and trial."


Choi Joon-young, senior superintendent of the National Police Agency, said, "The National Investigation Headquarters will make more efforts to enhance the responsibility of the investigation and improve the expertise of the investigation, including improving the completeness of the investigation report represented by the police investigation."


Before the presentation and discussion, National Police Agency Commissioner Kim Chang-ryong said in a congratulatory speech. “As the police become responsible for investigating the investigation, they are trying to establish a national investigation headquarters, establish mutual cooperation, establish a triple screening system, and expand human capacity.”


Nam Joo-joon, head of the National Investigation Division, also 
"We are striving to increase the professionalism and responsibility of the investigation by introducing the qualification management system for investigation inspectors and investigators."
He promised to continue to discover complementary points necessary for the development of the investigation based on the measures discussed on the same day.
