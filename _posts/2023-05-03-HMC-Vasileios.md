In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the field of IT-related crimes has become increasingly significant, prompting the evolution of a distinguished program within the department. This program aims to delve into the legal aspects surrounding such crimes, conduct scientific investigations, and nurture talented individuals capable of tackling complex problems through the intersection of technology and law.

To enrich the educational experience of undergraduate students in the School of Global Studies, Professor Vasileios, an esteemed researcher in the relevant fields, was invited to deliver a special lecture. The lecture encompassed a wide range of topics pertaining to hacktivism, exploring both its theoretical foundations and practical applications. Throughout the session, the history of hacktivism was examined, along with the various strategies and techniques employed by hacktivists. The lecture also highlighted both successful and unsuccessful cases of hacktivism, offering valuable insights into the subject.

Moreover, the lecture provided a valuable opportunity for students to develop a comprehensive understanding of hacktivism. Following the lecture, a meeting was arranged to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and foster academic collaboration with an overseas university. This collaboration aimed to promote further exploration of hacktivism and its implications, encouraging students to engage in meaningful research and contribute to the field's advancement.
