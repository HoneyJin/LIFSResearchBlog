Early 2019, saw one of the most wired nation unveiling its National Cyber Security Strategy. 
A strategy that will place cyberspace an independent operational domain just like the sea or air,
which in its totality requires state-level defence systems. What does the Strategy document say or mean?
This post will focus on the Strategy pillars, goals and building principles.

### 6 Pillars of the Strategy
* Increase the Safety of National Core Infrastructure
* Enhance Cyber Attack Response Capabilities
* Establish Governance Based on Trust and Cooperation
* Build Foundations for Cybersecurity Industry Growth
* Foster a Cybersecurity Culture
* Lead International Cooperation in Cybersecurity

### The Vision
Create a free and safe cyberspace to support national security,
promote economic prosperity, and contribute to international peace

### The Goals
1. Ensure stable operations of the state: Strengthen the
security and resilience of the nation's core infrastructure to
enable continuous operation despite any cyber threats
2. Respond to cyberattacks: Strengthen security capabilities
to deter cyber threats, detect and block them quickly, and
respond to any incident promptly
3. Build a strong cybersecurity foundation by nurturing a fair and
autonomous ecosystem where cybersecurity technology,
human resources, and industries are competitive

### The principles
1. Balance individual rights with cybersecurity: Strike a balance between protecting cyberspace and safeguarding the fundamental rights of the people, e.g. privacy.
2. Conduct security activities based on the rule of law:
Carry out the government's cybersecurity policies and
activities in a transparent manner and in compliance with the
domestic and international laws
3. Build a system of participation and cooperation:
Encourage individuals, businesses, and the government
to participate in cybersecurity activities, and pursue close
partnership with the international community

This strategy paves the way for South Korea to continue to address the increased vulnerabilities in the cyberspace
and the ever-changing environment. Continued review and evaluation of the implementation plans will be critical
in meeting the set goals and vision. The strategy also seeks to address global and national collaborative aspects in combating cyber threats. They propose elaborations on roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders to create a culture of security practice and awareness.
