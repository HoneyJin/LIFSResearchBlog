**4. Trends in Case Analysis and Visualization - Arguments, Stories, and Criminal Evidence**

At the end of this seminar, Professor Floris Bex of Utrecht University in the Netherlands gave a presentation on “Trends in Case Analysis and Visualization - Arguments, Stories, and Criminal Evidence”. 

The professor explained the artificial intelligence technology currently used by the Dutch police, focusing on the trend of case analysis and visualization based on argumentation, story, and evidence of criminal cases. 

We had a useful time in future research at Hallym University through overseas police investigation methods using artificial intelligence as well as in Korea.
