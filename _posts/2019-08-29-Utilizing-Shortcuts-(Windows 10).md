## Why shortcuts?

Computers are everwhere, both physically and socially, and it is almost impossible to imagine a day without carrying out a task using a computer or utilizing a service that was generated from someone else, also, using a computer.

Yet, we all know that there is only a handful of actions that people repeatedly take such as opening Web Browser, MS Office, Messengers, etc.

The issue here is that a chunk of time is always wasted every time you take such mundane actions because of the "pretty" graphics that are included in clicking anything on screen.

There are tons of "how to make my Windows 10 faster" articles on Web, but I usually have to stumble through some wordy and obsolete contents to find the simple direction that actually works.

There are some cool tricks that will make you "click" less frequenty, and I have made the 'how to' part shorter and more intuitive. 

These tips are usually for Windows 10, so feel free to tune in.
