Below is a video taking you step-by-step through how to update the LIFS Research Blog on Github.
The process seems complicated, but once you get used to it, it is very easy. The basic steps are:

1. Fork the research blog repository into your own account
2. Clone the forked repository into your local computer
3. Switch to the *gh-pages* branch (git checkout gh-pages)
4. Move to the _posts directory
5. Copy an older post as a template. Change the date and file name.
6. Edit the post file with a text editor. Save.
7. Commit the post to github. (git add .; git commit -m "new post"; git push)
8. In github in your local repository, make sure you are on the gh-pages branch. Click "make pull request"
9. Add a message to me saying what the pull request is about.
10. DONE! I will check it within a few days. If everything is ok, I will merge it with our main site.
