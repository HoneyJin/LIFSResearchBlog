Ethiopian veteran Museum is built for the remembrance of [Ethiopians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagnew_Battalion) participated during the Korean War. 
The museum is located near the Chuncheon river. It is fun to have a coffee in coffee shops by the river. But if you wanna have the taste of original Ethiopian Coffee, there is a coffee shop named "Ethiopia Bet" right across the museum. 
The coffee shop serves coffee that made Ethiopian way.
