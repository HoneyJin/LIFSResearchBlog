##What kind of documentation is needed to make Bank account and Alien number?

This is for the foreign students who are just starting the school.

For Bank account (this is a standard for Woori Bank),

You need...

* Certificate of enrollment = Registration certificate
  **If no certificate of enrollment, Scholarship certificate and Standard admission letter is fine. You can ask to Graduate admin for it.
* Passport
* Residency confirmation
  **The house contract with your name (if you live in the dormitory, you can get it from school) or Alien card (The card contains your residence address)
 
 
However, to get Alien card, you need Certificate of enrollment. That means you need to pay school fee first to get the student ID to print out the certificate. 
It is bit strange but this is how it works.


For Alien number,

You need...

* Passport
* Copy of passport
* Passport photo
* Certificate of enrollment
* 30,000 won in cash to apply
* Application for Integration (you can download from the Website https://www.hikorea.go.kr/)
And if you live off campus with your friend,
* Accomodation offer confirmation (also available from the website)
* Front and back copy of ID card (If the house contract is in your friend's name) 

**You need to make a book one day before you go to the immigration
