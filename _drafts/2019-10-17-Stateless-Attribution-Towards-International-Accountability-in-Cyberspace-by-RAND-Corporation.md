## Attribution of Cybercrime
While both cybercrime and traditional crime may cause various forms and degree of damages to a society, the attribution of a cybercrime could be far more difficult compared to that of a traditional crime. Following example was proposed in Tallinn Manual 2.0.

"X who is a national of State A, but located in State B, may conduct a cyber operation against a web server in State C in order to steal the bank information of individuals located in State D."

Due to the open structure of the Internet and intricate dynamics of international politics, to say the least, holding an individual, an organization, or a state accountable for a cybercrime is quite problematic.

In tackling this problem, the authors of "Stateless Attribution: Towards International Accountability in Cyberspace" analyze the challenges of cyber attribution and proposes the establishment of an international organization responsible for facilitating cyber attribution to facilitate the attribution process.

## Challenges of Cyber Attribution
First, since the Internet, with its open structure, provides the pertetrators with a chance of entry and a degree of anonymity, malicious actors can intrude on networks and even deliver effects that can go undetected for weeks, if not years. 

Also, the spectrum of spatial scales may vary greatly ranging from local targets to global targets over great distances . As a result, an attacker, who could be literally anyone in the world, can route attacks through compromised innocent third parties and obfuscate their origin. 

The type of evidence required for attribution is greatly different from the type for a traditional crime. While the attribution of traditional crimes required physical evidence that can be observed and recorded such as trajectory of a missle or bullet casing, that of cybercrimes requires digital evidence such as scripts and code. In the same context, traditional legal cases are frequently based on "unique" identifiers that are static and are globally unique or at least rarely (if ever) repeated, such as fingerprints or DNA, but cybercrime cases involve "dynamic" type of evidence such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 

Lastly, even if the body of evidence that is sufficient for convicting an entity beyond a reasonable doubt, the manner of publicization must be contemplated with prudence. For instnace, how should an attribution declaration be worded if a nation’s leadership only implicitly encourages a cyber attack or knows it is happening but looks away? Even if one identifies the persons involved in the attack, the relationship between the person or persons and host country may be murky.

## Global Consortium for Cyber Attribution (Proposal)
Therefore, the authors propose the establishment of an international organization responsible for facilitating cyber attribution, to take the role of an expert witness, with the following features

* Formal Triggering Condition Standards
  - The request for review is initiated by victim (an aggrieved party)
  - Internal constraints
  - Vote of a minority of justices to hear a case
* Evidence-Collection Process
  - Specify artifacts from the victim and third parties (Types of artifacts & Duration of access)
  - Use of confidentiality agreements (to protect Intellectual Property)
* Evidence-Assessment Framework
  - Weighting of individual pieces of evidence (Technical > Non-Technical)
  - Deployment of consortium members
  - A consensus conclusion based on the individual findings (Major & Minor opinions)
* Attribution Confidence Standards
  - Ensure integrity by differentiating: Assumptions, Judgments, Fact-based analysis
  - Addressment of the areas of weak & missing evidence
* Notification and Public Statement Procedures
  - Period for relevant parties to offer responses or critiques of the findings before publicization
  - Public statements shall include:
    - Consortium’s attribution actions and the rationales behind
    - Transparency and evidence-based consensus (majority/minority reports)
    - Publishable technical details for broader assessment and discussion
    - Written and verbal statements to be used as testimony in international and national deliberations
* Severity and Sophistication Assessment Procedures
  - Severity
    - Physical costs
    - Threats to political independence
    - Financial loss (e.g. the Sony Pictures Attack)
  - Sophistication
    - Needs to be discussed by GCAC
